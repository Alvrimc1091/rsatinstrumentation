  - Connect the camera module to the CSI (Camera Serial Interface) port on your Raspberry Pi. Ensure that the cable is inserted correctly and securely.
  - Enable the camera interface on your Raspberry Pi by following these steps:
    
    - Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
    - Run the command sudo raspi-config.
    - Select "Interfacing Options" and press Enter.
    - Select "Camera" and press Enter.
    - Choose "Yes" to enable the camera interface.
    - Reboot your Raspberry Pi for the changes to take effect.
      
  - Make sure the camera module is properly connected.
  - Save the Python script as a .py file, modify the file_path variable to specify the desired location to save the captured image, and run the script.
  - The script will initialize the camera, capture an image, and save it to the specified file path.


You can customize the camera settings by uncommenting and modifying the optional lines in the script. For example, you can set the resolution, rotation,
